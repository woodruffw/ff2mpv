# HACK(ww): On macOS, graphical applications inherit their path from `launchd`
# rather than the default path list in `/etc/paths`. `launchd` doesn't include
# `/usr/local/bin` in its default list, which means that any installations
# of MPV and/or youtube-dl under that prefix aren't visible when spawning
# from, say, Firefox. The real fix is to modify `launchd.conf`, but that's
# invasive and maybe not what users want in the general case.
# Hence this nasty hack.
